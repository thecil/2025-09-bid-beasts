# High Issues

## H-1: ETH transferred without address checks

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	    function settleAuction(uint256 tokenId) external isListed(tokenId) {
	```

	```solidity
	    function withdrawAllFailedCredits(address _receiver) external {
	```

</details>



## H-2: Reentrancy: State change after external call

Changing state after an external call can lead to re-entrancy attacks.Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to avoid this issue.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 69](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L69)

	State is changed at: `listings[tokenId] = Listing({
            seller: msg.sender,
            minPrice: _minPrice,
            buyNowPrice: _buyNowPrice,
            auctionEnd: 0, // Timer starts only after the first valid bid.
            listed: true
        })`
	```solidity
	        require(BBERC721.ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
	```

	State is changed at: `listings[tokenId] = Listing({
            seller: msg.sender,

            auctionEnd: 0, // Timer starts only after the first valid bid.
            listed: true
        })`
	```solidity
	        BBERC721.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId);
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 8](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	contract BidBeastsNFTMarket is Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 245](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L245)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawFee() external onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol [Line: 8](src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	contract BidBeasts is ERC721, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol [Line: 16](src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol#L16)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address to) public onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Address State Variable Set Without Checks

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 57](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	        BBERC721 = BidBeasts(_BidBeastsNFT);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>5 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 254](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L254)

	```solidity
	    function getListing(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (Listing memory) {
	```

- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 258](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L258)

	```solidity
	    function getHighestBid(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (Bid memory) {
	```

- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 262](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L262)

	```solidity
	    function getOwner() public view returns (address) {
	```

- Found in src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol [Line: 16](src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol#L16)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address to) public onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
	```

- Found in src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol [Line: 24](src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol#L24)

	```solidity
	    function burn(uint256 _tokenId) public {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Literal Instead of Constant

Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals. If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 153](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L153)

	```solidity
	            requiredAmount = (previousBidAmount / 100) * (100 + S_MIN_BID_INCREMENT_PERCENTAGE);
	```

- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 212](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L212)

	```solidity
	        uint256 fee = (bid.amount * S_FEE_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
	```

</details>



## L-5: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 2](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity 0.8.20;
	```

- Found in src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol [Line: 2](src/BidBeasts_NFT_ERC721.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity 0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-6: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 235](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L235)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawAllFailedCredits(address _receiver) external {
	```

</details>



## L-7: State Variable Could Be Immutable

State variables that are only changed in the constructor should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol [Line: 9](src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol#L9)
